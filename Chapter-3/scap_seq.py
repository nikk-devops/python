#Sequence of characters after backslash "\" → Escape Sequence characters
# Escape Sequence characters comprise of more than one character but represent one
# character when used within the strings.

# E.g \n → New Line
#     \t → Tab Space      
# Some commonly used Escape Sequence characters in Python are:
# 1. \n : New Line
# 2. \t : Tab Space
# 3. \\ : Backslash
# 4. \' : Single Quote
# 5. \" : Double Quote
# Example to demonstrate Escape Sequence characters in Python
print("Hello,\nWorld!")  # New Line
print("Hello,\tWorld!")  # Tab Space
print("This is a backslash: \\")  # Backslash
print('It\'s a beautiful day!')  # Single Quote 
print("He said, \"Hello!\"")  # Double Quote
